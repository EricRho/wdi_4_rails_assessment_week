* The routes for the `Photo` resource should be nested under the `User` resource. What line should I put in `config/routes.rb` to create a complete set of nested RESTful routes for these resources?

* When do I use `has_many` vs `has_many :through`?


* How can I I iterate through all of the articles associated with the current user? Write the code that would make this happen.

* How can I create a new article associated with a user who has_many articles? 


* What method does Devise give us that represents a user who is logged in?

* What command runs my migrations on Heroku?

* What command will show the logs on Heroku?
